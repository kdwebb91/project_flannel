TAMU CSCE 470 Final Project

-----------------------

Checkpoint 2: Core Algorithm

The core algorithm implementation for Hubs & Authorities is included in HITS.py.  
The algorithm can be tested with the tests provided in HITS_tests.py by running nosetests.

The "Flannel" directory provides a Visual Studio 2012 C# Console Application Project.
This includes the necessary code for interaction with the SQLite databases.

The "WebProject" directory is a temp. directory with all of the current webpage project data.
Eventually, all of the code will be migrated together and probably end up living in one project. 
The web site is a MVC application, developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 for Web.  Most of the
code is located in HomeController.cs and Main.cshtml.
